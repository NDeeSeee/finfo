Alright Valerii — let’s ship this. Here’s a tight MVP plan that bakes in your asks (versioning header, interactive ↑/↓ actions, modern bars/colors, “Is it safe?”, creator fields) and sets you up for a viral demo.

MVP (10–14 hours to first demo)

Stack (macOS/arm64-first): Go + Bubble Tea (TUI) + Lipgloss (theming). Bubble Tea is a production‑ready TUI framework; Lipgloss handles ANSI/TrueColor cleanly.  ￼ ￼

1) CLI + header (ver. 0.1.0)
	•	Command: finfo FILE…
	•	Header shows: filename • short type • size • lines • Workflow version:
	•	CWL: parse cwlVersion. WDL: parse version directive.  ￼ ￼
	•	Git snippet (branch/short SHA) if tracked.
	•	Flags: --brief | --long | --json | --porcelain | --theme dracula|nord|solarized | --no-color | --hash blake3|sha256

2) Pretty sections (non‑interactive mode)
	•	Essentials: MIME + UTType, owner:group, perms (symbolic+octal).
	•	Timeline: absolute + relative times.
	•	Paths: rel/abs.
	•	Security: Is it safe? verdict (one line):
	•	Gatekeeper assessment (spctl --assess), codesign identity, notarization/staple state, quarantine/provenance/WhereFroms.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Creator: Spotlight fields (kMDItemCreator, kMDItemAuthors) when present.  ￼

3) Interactive inspector (finfo -i)
	•	Layout: left list of files; right metadata panel.
	•	↑/↓ select; Enter details; c copy path/hash (uses pbcopy); m move; o open in Finder; r “rewrite” (safe‑guarded replace/format op with confirm); ? help overlay (hotkey legend).
	•	Built with Bubble Tea + Bubbles “list” + Lipgloss themes.  ￼
	•	Bars/Coloring: subtle spark bars for size; theme presets (Dracula/Nord/Solarized) with TrueColor→256 fallback and NO_COLOR honored.  ￼

4) Viral “wow” add‑on (day 2): inline thumbnails
	•	If terminal supports it, render a small thumbnail for images/PDF page 1/video first frame:
	•	Kitty graphics protocol and iTerm2’s inline images (imgcat) with graceful fallback.  ￼ ￼
	•	(Optional note in help: Kitty/wezterm support kitty; iTerm2 has its own protocol.)  ￼

5) Diff & HTML (thin slice)
	•	finfo diff A B → side‑by‑side metadata diff (size, times, xattrs, UTType, signer, quarantine/provenance).
	•	--html single self‑contained report for PRs/forensics.

⸻

Design system (so it looks “fancy‑modern”)
	•	One accent hue per theme; section titles in dim accent; values neutral; parenthetical metadata dimmed.
	•	Grid, not tree. Labels left‑aligned (12ch), values column‑aligned.
	•	Icons only in headers (if Nerd Font detected), never every row.
	•	Accessibility: ≥4.5:1 contrast; TrueColor when available; clean 256‑color and mono fallbacks.  ￼

Safety/provenance details you’ll surface (and why they’ll share screenshots)
	•	Gatekeeper quirks on macOS 15+: spctl now limited; still fine for per‑file assessment (--assess) to power the verdict.  ￼
	•	Codesign identity & validity (codesign -dv/--verify --deep --strict).  ￼ ￼
	•	Notarization via notarytool status (and staple presence).  ￼
	•	Quarantine flag meaning and decoding (agent/epoch/flags) + WhereFroms URL.  ￼ ￼
	•	(If present) Apple’s com.apple.provenance xattr summarized count-only by default.  ￼

JSON schema (stable for CI)

  }
}

Roadmap after MVP (to really differentiate)
	1.	Watch mode (finfo watch path) → live stream when xattrs/timestamps/trust change (APFS/FSEvents).  ￼
	2.	Lineage view: “Downloaded by Safari → quarantined → unzipped → provenance present (2 claims) → first opened …” (WhereFroms + quarantine agent + provenance).  ￼
	3.	Spotlight bridge (finfo query 'kMDItemCreator == "Pages"') to filter and jump straight into the inspector.  ￼

⸻

If you’re good with this scope, I’ll generate a starter repo layout (Go) next: cmd/finfo, internal/ui (Bubble Tea), internal/meta (mdls/xattr/git/codesign/spctl/notarytool), themes/, and tests with golden outputs for --json and pretty modes. Want me to scaffold it?



Alright—let’s dream bigger. These are five novel, intuitive, and surprisingly “obvious-in-hindsight” features that would make your tool feel like magic—convenient, context-aware, intuitive, and still demanding in terms of utility:

⸻

1. Media-Aware Inline Summaries

What → For any media file (images, audio, video, PDFs), display key metadata (e.g., resolution, duration, codec, EXIF, page count) inline, succinctly—without needing exiftool or external metadata editors.
Why overlooked? Most CLIs separate file-inspection and metadata tasks. Combining them into one glanceable view in your tool is a huge UX win.
Proof there’s need: Users complain they can’t easily get video duration or resolution in terminal on macOS without workarounds  ￼.

⸻

2. Arithmetic & Conversion Smart Field

What → If user pipes or queries the size, show toggles (e.g., press s) to switch units (bytes ⇄ IEC/KiB, MB). Or, highlight mtime and allow quick conversion to RFC3339 or Unix timestamp. Editable in place.
Why it feels magical? Reduces cognitive friction—no more manual math or floating between tools. It’s intuitive and surprisingly rare.

⸻

3. Command Buttons / Copy-Paste Boundaries

What → Make hashes, paths, checksums, and trust-verdicts into clickable/copyable “buttons” (on click if supported) or automatic selections on mouse hover/copy in iTerm2. Even better: hovering paths highlights them for quick Cmd-C copy.
Why stand out? CLI tools usually dump raw text. Making common values instantly copyable turns routine “inspect → copy → paste” into one fluid motion.

⸻

4. Contextual Suggestions & Fix Prompts

What → If file is “unsafe” (quarantine flag on), show a small call-to-action: [Press Q to clear quarantine] or [press O to open in Finder]. If code-sign is missing, suggest codesign --sign “…”.
Why it’s intuitive? Instead of blaming the user, your tool gently → guides them. Smart, context-aware suggestions are rare in metadata tools and feel immediately helpful.

⸻

5. Smart File Group Summaries

What → When running against directory or multiple files, automatically group by extension/type (e.g., “3 PDFs, 2 scripts, 1 binary”) and show aggregated metadata (largest, oldest, trust-flag counts). Expandable groups (→) to dive in.
Why it matters? We often run ls + finfo *.dmg *.zip. Giving an overview by category first respects our brain—surface the structure, then details on demand.

⸻

Why These Ideas Are Game-Changers
	•	Saves cognitive load by surfacing relevant info smartly.
	•	Contextually actionable—if something’s wrong, you’re nudged gently but helpfully.
	•	Built for power users, but approachable even when you’re in flow.
	•	All low friction to use, yet deliver agency, comfort, and delight.

⸻

Let me know which one you’d like to prototype next—or if you’d like me to help compose a little Bubble Tea snippet that shows the media summary + smart button behavior.

Totally — let’s dream way bigger. These five radical, “how didn’t anyone think of that sooner?” features blend delight, context-awareness, and magic. I dug around — no existing macOS CLI bundles all these seamlessly — so you’ll be striking rare ground. Ready?

⸻

1. Visionary File Relationships

What: Show “linked files”—for instance, detect if the same file exists elsewhere by content (not just path), identify hard links, snapshots, duplicate hashes on external drives, or symlinks across APFS clones.
Why: Users rarely see file relationships at a glance. Think “This config file is also in 3 other branches of this project.”
Innovative edge: Visualizing dataset forks, shared binaries, or duplicate assets across workflow runs.

⸻

2. Smart Provenance Timeline

What: Auto-generate a mini “storyboard” of file events: e.g.

Created by Python3 script → zipped with zip v3.0 → downloaded via Safari → quarantined → unzipped in Finder → first opened Jun 5.  

Constructed from xattrs (WhereFroms, provenance), Finder history, and APFS snapshot times.
Why: Humans think in stories. Metadata fragments don’t cut it; an intuitive timeline feels human-first.

⸻

3. Embed Flow Visualization

What: For editable documents (scripts, notebooks, JSON, markdown), show a mini sparklines-like flow next to line counts—e.g., “Last edited 5h ago → 10 lines added → 2 blocks deleted”; or for logs/video, show quick visual flow of size over time or resolution over multiple versions.
Why: You feel the file lifecycle, not just see numbers. It’s like a code-smell but visualized.

⸻

4. Gesture-Friendly Natural Language

What: Natural-language querying and commands— finfo > “when was this last edited?” or finfo >> “copied to project XXX?”, and the tool auto-detects relevant fields (modification time, owner, venv path, etc.).
Why: Low-effort queries let you stay in flow. It’s literal magic—type like you would ask aloud, get precise results.

⸻

5. Self-Aware File Templates

What: Detect known file types (Dockerfile, CWL, WDL, Python, Markdown) and, for each, embed context-aware quick actions: e.g., finfo show Dockerfile displays “base image”, layers, exposed ports. For markdown: show TOC, word count, or image count inline.
Why: Facts + context = understanding. It transforms reading a file from raw bytes into meaningful insights.

⸻

Why these are game-changers
	•	Feels human: timelines and stories, not dry metadata dumps.
	•	Context-first: relationships and templates surface relevant meaning instantly.
	•	Low effort: natural querying and gesture-readiness make flow unbroken.
	•	Visceral delight: visual sparklines and linked-forest views surprise and delight.

⸻

I scoured macOS toolkit lists—there’s no one doing visual storytell + timeline + relational insight for general files. You’ll be first. If one strikes your creative chords, I can prototype a TUI mock for it in Bubble Tea. Let me know which one you’d love to demo first.

Ohh I know what you mean—“once you see it, you can’t un‑want it.” Here are five truly new, high‑leverage revelations a file inspector can surface on macOS that most people don’t even know exist. Each idea includes why it’s magical, how it works under the hood, and a one‑line UI hook.

⸻

1) Space‑Truth: the real bytes you’d reclaim

Why it hits: On APFS, copies can be clones (copy‑on‑write). Deleting one often frees less space than Finder claims. This feature shows the actual reclaimable bytes for a file right now by accounting for clones, hard links, and even snapshot references.
How: Explain APFS clones (shared blocks), detect hard links, and warn that many tools can’t tell you clone overlap; snapshots also pin blocks. Show “reclaimable if you delete” vs “apparent size.”  ￼ ￼ ￼
UI hook: Reclaimable: ~12.3 MB (cloned in 3 places; 1 APFS snapshot holds 4.1 MB)

⸻

2) Time‑Capsule Diff: instant past versions without Git

Why it hits: macOS keeps APFS/Time Machine local snapshots; almost nobody uses them to diff a single file’s history. Scroll a timeline and see exactly what changed last Tuesday, even if the project wasn’t under VCS.
How: Enumerate APFS/Time Machine local snapshots and open a read‑only copy to diff/preview side‑by‑side—then one‑key restore.  ￼ ￼ ￼
UI hook: Press T to time‑travel ▸ 2025‑08‑03 21:14 (restore | diff)

⸻

3) Origin Consensus: public attestations + Apple trust in one verdict

Why it hits: Notarization/code‑signing ≠ supply‑chain provenance. Fuse Apple’s Gatekeeper/codesign/notary checks with SLSA/in‑toto attestations and a Sigstore Rekor transparency lookup by hash. If your binary matches a public, signed build record, that’s a huge trust upgrade.
How: Do spctl --assess, parse codesign/hardened‑runtime/notarization; then query Sigstore Rekor for entries by digest and validate any GitHub/Docker “build‑provenance” attestations (SLSA v1). Show a green “origin consensus” badge only when both worlds agree.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
UI hook: Is it safe?  ✅ notarized • signed by TEAMID • Rekor match (SLSA provenance found)

⸻

4) Metadata‑Survival Forecast: what will be stripped in iCloud/sync

Why it hits: Moving files through iCloud/other sync often silently strips xattrs (tags, resource forks, custom metadata). That can break workflows or erase provenance. Show a survival score and the exact keys at risk before you move/commit.
How: Inspect extended attributes (e.g., kMDItemWhereFroms, Finder tags, resource forks), then predict survivability using known iCloud behaviors (what’s preserved vs dropped, placeholders like .icloud). Provide a one‑tap “wrap & preserve” (export to a small sidecar/RO‑Crate).  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
UI hook: Survival in iCloud: 2/5  (will drop: ResourceFork, user tags)  — press P to package

⸻

5) Entropy Radar: where secrets or packing hide

Why it hits: High‑entropy zones flag encrypted blobs, packed sections, embedded keys, or suspicious archives inside binaries/docs. A tiny bar‑heatmap instantly shows where the weirdness lives—then one key opens a focused hex/strings view.
How: Compute sliding‑window Shannon entropy across the file; highlight spikes and correlate with EXIF, PDF streams, Mach‑O segments, etc. This is a staple in malware forensics—but almost no general file tool makes it one‑key simple.  ￼ ￼ ￼
UI hook: Entropy map █▁██▆▁▁█ …  (press E to jump to high‑entropy region)

⸻

Bonus: tiny delights that amplify the magic
	•	Lineage story in plain English from xattrs/provenance: “Downloaded via Chrome from X on Jul 2 → quarantined → opened once.”  ￼ ￼
	•	Creator beyond POSIX owner: show app/author fields from Spotlight (kMDItemCreator, kMDItemAuthors).  ￼
	•	Open‑handles whisperer: who’s locking this file (lsof) and one‑tap “reveal/kill” suggestion (with confirmation).
	•	Trust‑first actions: “Staple notarization” if missing, or “clear quarantine” with a warning & link to Apple docs.  ￼

If you’re into it, I can spec which APIs/commands we’d call for each feature and sketch the UI states (non‑interactive vs TUI) so you can build a wow‑worthy demo fast.

You’re pushing me—and I’m loving it. Let’s critically examine: do any of these features trigger that electrifying, “OMG, I never knew I needed this so much” reaction?

⸻

Critique of My Five Golden Features
	1.	Real reclaimable space (APFS clone-awareness)
	•	Strength: Rarely mentioned; users are mystified when deleting files doesn’t free space—this pinpoints exactly why.
	•	Risk: Requires low-level APFS insight (blocks, clones, snapshots)—uncommon knowledge—but that’s also its magic.
	•	Verdict: Strong contender for “I needed that.”
	2.	Version-diff via local snapshots
	•	Strength: Time Machine snapshots are invisible to most, yet developers wildly wish they could roll back individual files without diving into the backup UI.
	•	Risk: Implementation complexity could hold it back, but if it works smoothly, it will feel magical.
	•	Verdict: Pure delight; huge “aha” potential.
	3.	Public provenance via Sigstore/SLSA + Apple trust
	•	Strength: For security-conscious users, merging Apple certs with public attestations is novel—not many tools even think to do this.
	•	Risk: Very niche; powerful for a subset, but obscure to many.
	•	Verdict: Brilliant for the security crowd—but not everyone will “get it.”
	4.	iCloud metadata survival predictor
	•	Strength: Metadata vanishes silently in sync—this unveils a hidden, painful UX problem.
	•	Risk: Limited audience; but for those relying on tags & provenance, it’s a revelation.
	•	Verdict: Feels like a hidden Apple UX trap exposed. Could surprise many, yes.
	5.	Entropy radar with heatmap jump
	•	Strength: Malware forensic folk know entropy, but making it visible for everyday users to spot hidden blobs/code is power.
	•	Risk: Conceptually advanced; most users don’t know what entropy is, reducing immediate “OMG” reaction.
	•	Verdict: Magic for a geeks-only niche—wow-worthy, but not universal.

⸻

Which feel most like hidden, visceral revelations?
	•	Version-diff via Time Machine snapshots — Invisible history that you tap to reveal. Truly magical.
	•	Real reclaimable space — “Wait… deleting doesn’t help? Now I understand.” Users will screenshot that.
	•	iCloud metadata survival — Once you see metadata you lose across sync, you’ll never forget that tool.

The other two are incredible, but they sit in specialist domains (security, forensics). They’re more delight than existential; still, in the right demo, absolutely mind-blowing.

⸻

Final word

Yes—I stand by these as powerful, but your heart targets are snapshot version-diff, clone-aware reclaim, and metadata survival forecast. They expose invisible truths about modern filesystems and sync: deeply useful and surprisingly emotional.

Want me to pick one and wireframe a UI prototype (TUI or even webpage) that nails that moment of revelation? Just say the word.


Absolutely—let’s crank this up to legendary. These five proposals tap into deeply hidden macOS mechanics—things most users don’t even know can exist—packed into intuitive, jaw-dropping magic. Each opens a new frontier.

⸻

1. Ghost Fork Revealer

Why it wows: macOS still supports resource forks (and AppleDouble . _ companions), which often invisibly store icons and metadata—especially when moving files across non-APFS volumes  ￼.
Magic UX: A “ghost indicator” shows that a file has a hidden resource fork or AppleDouble twin. Pressing G reveals a human-readable breakdown: icons, metadata, resource payload. Clicking “merge” seamlessly reincorporates or strips it.
Emotional gut-punch: Most users never realize part of the file exists in hiding. Suddenly seeing “you’ve got secret file siblings” is deeply satisfying.

⸻

2. File Slack Whisperer

Why it’s hidden gold: Unused slack space (leftover bytes after file data) can hold ghosts from previous versions or hidden data—an anti-forensic classic. Forensics tools whisper about it, but almost no one ever sees it on macOS  ￼.
Magic UX: A toggle or “whisper” button draws a subtle sparkline or heatbar showing slack density. Pressing S dumps it in hex viewer. It reveals secrets—deleted keys, embedded macros, paste shadows—without needing full forensic effort.
Heart trigger: We all suspect things linger—this shows it visually. Instant “how did I—?!” moment.

⸻

3. APFS Compression Insight

Why it’s hidden treasure: APFS supports transparent compression (LZFSE, Zlib, LZVN), but it’s invisible unless you use specialized tools  ￼.
Magic UX: See not just file size, but compressed footprint: “438 KB (compressed: 123 KB, +72% savings)”. Press C to decompress in-place preview or compare compressed vs. raw stats visually.
Emotional hook: Suddenly your documents are smaller than they feel—like finding hidden pockets of space.

⸻

4. Silent Snapshot Anchor

Why it’s underused: APFS snapshots silently pin file states, even when you overwrite; it’s critical for undelete—but few tools expose it  ￼ ￼.
Magic UX: If a rogue snapshot holds an older version, you see a “time anchor” badge in metadata. Press A to restore just that file from the snapshot, no full restore required—instant rewind.
Why it resonates: It’s like a hidden “undo” for life. That instant safety net—pure comfort.

⸻

5. Hidden Cache Map

Why it surprises: macOS stores caches and thumbnails in deeply hidden paths (e.g. thumbnail caches, Spotlight crumbs) that silently bloat around files  ￼.
Magic UX: A quick map shows associated cache paths (e.g., .DS_Store, thumbnail caches) and how much space they eat. Press K to purge or open cache in Finder.
Emotional pull: Suddenly you’re seeing the “invisible overhead” of a file—like displaying the ghosts that follow it.

⸻

Final Critique & Value Triage

These features go deeper—into stealth tech that hides in plain sight. They’re:
	•	Surprise-first: resource forks, slack, snapshots, compression, caches—things users don’t know are happening.
	•	Easily graspable: each offers a visual hook (badges, bars, maps, heat lines).
	•	Emotionally powerful: they expose hidden layers, offering clarity, control, understanding.

Most folks will gasp at Ghost Fork Revealer (“I had a secret sibling?!”) and Silent Snapshot Anchor (“I can time-travel my file!”). The rest follow with forensic joy.

⸻

Let me know which of these speaks to your product soul, and I’ll sketch the TUI mockup + system call scaffolding so you can prototype the “OMG I needed this” moment.

Oh you want revolution? Let’s swing for it. Here are five unprecedented, “once you see it you’ll crave it” features—each surfaces information that’s real, measurable, and shockingly under‑exposed on macOS. I’ll give you the hook, why it lands emotionally, what it actually reads, and the technical spine so you can build it.

⸻

1) Openability Index — “Will this open here, right now?”

Why it hits: We waste time discovering missing interpreters, kernels, fonts, or dylibs only after we double‑click. This turns that pain into a single, honest score.
What it shows:
	•	Code & binaries: otool -L scan for unresolved dynamic libs; Mach‑O parse for arch, min macOS, and ABI flags.
	•	Notebooks: read kernelspec + authors from the .ipynb; tell me if that kernel exists locally.
	•	Docs: list required fonts (if referenced) and show whether they’re installed.
One‑line UX: Openability: 83% — missing: Python 3.11 kernel, 1 font (Inter-SemiBold), libssl.3.dylib
Build‑proof: Mach‑O & loader refs; Jupyter’s nbformat defines kernelspec & metadata you can parse directly.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

2) TCC Prompt Map — “Exactly which permission popups will this app trigger?”

Why it hits: Users hate mystery prompts. Developers need to audit them. Your tool predicts the actual macOS privacy prompts before first run.
What it shows:
	•	Parse Info.plist for usage keys (e.g., NSCameraUsageDescription, NSFaceIDUsageDescription, NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription, …) and entitlements (Hardened Runtime).
	•	Render a prompt timeline: “Camera → Microphone → Documents Folder”.
One‑line UX: Prompts: Camera, Mic, Documents — messages found; Hardened Runtime: enabled (3 opt‑outs)
Build‑proof: Apple’s docs require these keys; codesign/entitlements + Hardened Runtime determine capabilities.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

3) Privacy Risk Analyzer for Data Files — “How re‑identifiable is this CSV?”

Why it hits: Everyone shares “anonymous” tables that aren’t. You give a k‑anonymity snapshot right in the file inspector—no pandas notebook needed.
What it does:
	•	Heuristically detect quasi‑identifiers (ZIP, DOB, gender, etc.), estimate k over rows, and flag columns driving uniqueness.
	•	Offer fix‑hints (bin ages, truncate ZIP, drop rare combos).
One‑line UX: Re‑ID risk: HIGH — k=3 on (ZIP5, BirthYear, Sex). Press R for mitigation plan.
Build‑proof: k‑anonymity is a well‑established model; you’re applying a light, local estimator for instant feedback.  ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

4) Visual Forensics for Images — “Has this JPEG been edited (again)?”

Why it hits: People feel that an image isn’t original but can’t prove it. You surface double‑compression lineage and quantization fingerprints—visually.
What it does:
	•	Estimate the JPEG’s quantization tables and flag double‑JPEG artifacts; show a tiny “ancestry” bar (“Shot → recompressed once (social app) → edited”).
One‑line UX: Integrity: altered — double JPEG detected; Q-table suggests recompress (source likely social upload).
Build‑proof: Quantization analysis and double‑JPEG detection are well‑studied; wrapping them into a one‑tap verdict is new in a general file inspector.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

5) Repro Score + Supply‑Chain Proof — “Can we rebuild this bit‑for‑bit, and do others attest to it?”

Why it hits: Reproducibility is the new credibility—across science and software. One glance tells you whether an archive/wheel/JAR is deterministic, and whether a public transparency log agrees with its origin.
What it shows:
	•	Reproducible‑build score for ZIP/JAR/wheel (timestamps normalized? ordering stable?). Offer Fix: rewrite archive metadata to a deterministic form.
	•	Generate an SBOM and check Sigstore Rekor for matching attestations (SLSA provenance).
One‑line UX: Repro score: 92/100 — normalized; SBOM generated; Rekor: match found (cosign attestation).
Build‑proof: Reproducible Builds’ guidance on timestamps/ordering; Debian’s strip-nondeterminism; Syft SBOM; Rekor search and SLSA verifier patterns.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

Bonus: two microscopic delights that make demos go viral
	•	Snapshot‑aware size truth for APFS: “Delete impact today: 0 B — snapshot holds 47 MB; clones share 12 MB.” (People finally understand “why didn’t space free up?”)  ￼ ￼
	•	One‑key privacy scrub: EXIF/XMP/Office revision purge with precise keep‑lists (“strip all but Title/Keywords”).  ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

Why these five feel legendary
	•	They convert invisible complexity into actionable, human answers: “Will this open?”, “Which prompts?”, “Could this data dox someone?”, “Is this image original?”, “Can we rebuild and prove it?”
	•	They’re technically sound (cited) and CLI‑friendly. No heavy GUIs, no yak‑shaving.
	•	They create shareable moments: a single screenshot that settles an argument.

If you want, I’ll spec the minimal parsers for each (Mach‑O/otool, nbformat, JPEG Q‑table estimator, ZIP normalizer, SBOM+Rekor) and draft the exact TUI states + hotkeys so you can build the demo that melts Twitter/Reddit.

MY OWN THOUGHTS:
	MULTIPLE FILES SUPPORT / ARGUMENTS
	SHOWING LINKED FILES / SYMLINKS / SHARED LINKS
	INTERACTIVE MODE
	VERSIONING FOR PDF, DOCX, etc. (and how much of pages)
    SHORT FORMAT TO PRINT IN A HEADER (png - image, htm - web page etc. with simple but enough groups)
    SWITCHING BETWEEN SHORT AND LONG FORMAT (for example, for pdf, docx, etc.) should be easy
    FOR DIRS and FILE (probably) SHOW SIMPLE STATS LIKE (visited X times, etc.)
    ARCHIVES (zip, tar, etc.) unopened - should be shown with simple stats like (size, number of files, etc.)
        opened / unopened should be easy to open / archive with interactive mode
    IF FILE SIZE CHANGING FAST - SHOW A BAR WITH A PROGRESS OF DOWNLOADING / UPLOADING (for example, if you are downloading a file, and the size is changing fast, you should see a bar with a progress of downloading)
    FOR SCRIPTS IN HINTS SHOW A WAY OF RUNNING (like Rscript, python3 .py, etc., java -jar, cwltools etc. )
    ANONTATIONS FOR ALL FILETYPES
    FOR DIRS SHOW A WAY OF OPENING IN FINDER (like open .) OR OTHER SUPPOETED APPS (like open with vscode, sublime, cursor etc.)
    ADD PLUGINS LIKE SPELLCHECK, LINTING, etc.?
    SHOW DUPLICATES (for example, if you have a file with the same name in different directories, you should see a list of duplicates)
    SIZE NEED BOTH ABS VALUE AND RELATIVE VALUE (of dir, or entire system).
    ADD CONVERTATION for popular filetypes (for example, pdf to png, docx to html, etc., json to yaml, etc.)
    ADD CONVERSATION OF THE FILESIZE LIKE (1000000000 bytes = 1 GB)
    FOR TXT FILES SHOW delimiters
    FOR TXT FILES SHOW delimiters
    LINKED FILES (WHERE THEY ARE LINKED RUN OR WHAT FILES RUN IN THAT FILE AS A LIST)
    INTEGRATION WITH GIT, DOCKER, AWS, GCP, AZURE, etc.
    INSERTED AWK, GREP, LL (like show other files in the same directory), 
    IS FILE RUNNING NOW IN THE SOME PROCESS (like ps aux | grep file.txt)?
    FILEYTPE SPECIFIC STATS (# of pages, # of columns / rows, etc., $ of ...)
    FDIR WILL BE EITHER SEPARATE TOOL OR EXTENDED MERGED WITH FINFO
    CHANGE RIGHTS INTERACTIVELY (like arrow up / down for chmod of each of the rights, showing with that the resuls (so it have to be explained why those are 6 xy-))
    ADD AS A SEPARATE TOOL COMBINATION OF cd AND fd (from root selection) to go to the dir with that filename chosing by up/donw arrows chosing thte one you need
